S,HeightNew,Compute the canonical height of the rational point pt on the Kummer surface of a curve of genus 2 over the rationals. The curve must be given by an integral model of the form y^2 = f(x). The result is computed to Precision decimal digits after the point. Precision defaults to the precision of the default real field. TrialDivisionBound (default 1000) is used as a bound for a partial factorization of the discriminant of the curve,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,162,,402,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
