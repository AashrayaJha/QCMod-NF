S,HeightConstantNew,"If J is the Jacobian of a gneus 2 curve defined over the rationals, of the form y^2 = f(x) with integral coefficients, this computes a real number c such that h_K(P) le h(P) + c for all P in J(Q), where h_K is the naive logarithmic height obtained from the Kummer surface and h is the canonical height on J. The second value returned is a bound for |mu_infinity|. If Factor is set, then the discriminant will be factored, and its prime divisors will be considered individually. This usually results in an improvement of the bound. If Fast is set, the cheap bound from [Stoll 1999] is used (and Factor is ignored). If Modified is set, the modified naive height is used as in [MÃ¼ller-Stoll 2016]",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,,402,402,-38,-38,-38,-38
