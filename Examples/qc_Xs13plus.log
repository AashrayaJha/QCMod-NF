Rational points on Xns(13)+ [ (1 : -1 : 1), (2 : -2 : 1), (0 : 0 : 1), (-1/2 : 
-1 : 1), (-1 : 1 : 0), (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0) ]

  For completeness, we include the quadratic Chabauty computation as
  described in the paper `Explicit Chabauty-Kim for the split Cartan
  curve of level 13`, using the prime p=17 and a hard-coded basis of 
  H^1. 
  We leave out the computation of the rational points
  in the bad disk, since this is somewhat harder to incorporate into
  our main function (see qc_C188.m for an examples where this is applied).
